#Miuul - Feature Engineering Course Case 1 (Diabetes)
Business Problem: Developing a machine learning model to predict whether individuals have diabetes or not based on specified features. 
Prior to model development, performing the necessary data analysis and feature engineering steps is expected.

Dataset Story: The dataset is part of a large dataset maintained by the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases in the United States. 
It contains data used for a diabetes study conducted on Pima Indian women aged 21 and above, residing in Phoenix,
the fifth-largest city in the state of Arizona. The target variable, 'outcome,' is defined as 1 for a positive diabetes test result and 0 for a negative result.

Project Tasks:
Step 1: Examine the overall picture.
Step 2: Identify numeric and categorical variables.
Step 3: Perform analysis on numeric and categorical variables.
Step 4: Analyze the target variable. (Mean of the target variable by categorical variables, mean of numeric variables by the target variable)
Step 5: Perform outlier analysis.
Step 6: Perform missing observation analysis.
Step 7: Conduct correlation analysis.
Step 8: Handle missing and outlier values. Although there are no missing observations in the dataset, observations with zero values in variables such as Glucose, Insulin, etc., may indicate missing values. For example, a person's Glucose or Insulin value cannot be zero. Taking this into consideration, you can assign zero values as NaN in the relevant variables and then apply the necessary treatments for missing values.
Step 9: Create new variables.
Step 10: Perform encoding processes.
Step 11: Standardize numeric variables.
Step 12: Build the model.
